# Examining Stock Trade Trends

The following notebook analyzes publicly available information regarding stock trades made by US House of Representatives members to reach inferences. We first cleaned up the dataset and combined The 116th U.S. House of Representatives at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aavigan/house-of-representatives-congress-116 which contains information regarding political affiliation of congresspeople. Next, we evaluate the dataset's owner column's missingness association.

After that, we began processing the dataset for insights, and try to explore answers to the following questions:

Does one party trade more often?
Does one party make larger trades?
What congresspeople have made the most trades?
What companies are most traded by congresspeople?
When are stocks bought and sold? Is there a day of the week that is most common? Or a month of the year?
